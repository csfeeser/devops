<img src="https://i.redd.it/a5skfy5y88x11.jpg" alt="Image Description" width="300"/>

Your final project repo should include a README.md file! READMEs are formatted in Markdown, which you may not know-- but fun fact, ChatGPT output is always written in Markdown format! Click the little ðŸ“‹ icon in the ChatGPT output (don't highlight/copy).

You don't need to include ALL of these, but here are some suggestions of what to include:

- [ ] Project Title
- [ ] Brief Description: What the project does
- [ ] Table of Contents: For easy navigation
- [ ] Installation Steps: How to get your app running
- [ ] Usage: A quick guide or examples on using the project
- [ ] Features: Highlights of what your project can do
- [ ] Screenshots or GIFs: Show it in action
- [ ] Dependencies: List any libraries or services it relies on
- [ ] Roadmap: Future features or fixes
- [ ] Authors: Who's behind the project
- [ ] Acknowledgments: Shout-outs, inspiration, etc.
