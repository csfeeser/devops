This mini-project has been written to mimic the CKAD Exam! Below are a series of tasks that you are to complete inside your assigned Alta3 machine (the same one you've been using to complete your labs). 

- Tasks may be completed in any order!
- Tasks are PASS/FAIL- either you meet the criteria of the task or you don't!
- It is VITALLY IMPORTANT that you run the `setup` commands at the beginning of each task, otherwise you will not be able to complete the task.
- You are absolutely allowed to use ANY resources you want to find solutions (`kubernetes.io`, your labs, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Each task has a `teardown` option that will enable you to attempt that task again if need be!
- How you achieve each task **does not matter**- all that matters is that the final product matches the criteria of the task.

You can check if you solved the project by running the following command:

`student@bchd:~$` `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser/devops/main/ckad_score.py && python3 ckad_score.py`



## Task 1: API Primitives

<details>
<summary>Click here to view this task!</summary>

### Objectives
In this task, you'll be migrating a **Pod** from one particular **Namespace** to another. This tests our understanding of basic Kubernetes objects like containers, pods, services, and namespaces within a particular namespace. In this task specifically you'll demonstrate how to search for and identify a pod and its namespace, then move it to another namespace. Permitted reference material you can use while taking the **CKAD** exam can be found [here from kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#viewing-and-finding-resources) -- Good luck!

### Recommended Labs:
- Lab 51, step 13 (create manifest from an existing pod)
- Lab 15, step 15 (create an object on a specific namespace)

### Task Setup

1. Run the following command to setup the task.

    `student@bchd:~$` `drill api-primitives`
    
### Summary

Team Banana is taking over a webserver from Team Pineapple. No one from Pineapple is around anymore, so who knows where this webserver is. The only thing you know is that the Pod is named `apricot`. Search for the correct pod in namespace `pineapple` and migrate it in the namespace `banana`.

   > This involves knowing how to work with basic Kubernetes objects like containers, pods, services, deployments, and namespaces.
   
**Approximate Weight of Actual Exam Grade:** 4%

### Tasks

1. Identify the pod `apricot` in the namespace `pineapple`.
0. Migrate the pod `apricot` from the namespace `pineapple` to the namespace `banana`.
0. Verify the `pod` was migrated successfully.

### Task Re-Do

1. Want to run the task again?? Run the following script to teardown your work.

    `student@bchd:~$` `teardown api-primitives`

## Task 2: Pod Basics

<details>
<summary>Click here to view this task!</summary>

### Objectives

In this task. you'll be creating a **Pod** with specific parameters within a particular namespace. This task is testing your ability to, in a timely fashion, piece together a new **pod**. Luckily for us, we have the ability to grab a template pod manifest from our permitted reference materials, so there is no need to memorize everything about how to write a manifest, but it does help. Permitted reference material you can use while taking the **CKAD** exam can be found [here from kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#using-pods) -- Good luck!

### Recommended Labs:
- Lab 15, step 15 (create an object on a specific namespace)
- Lab 12 ðŸ’» Create and Configure Basic Pods

### Task Setup

1. Run the following command to setup the task.  

    `student@bchd:~$` `drill pod-basics`

### Summary

Create a single pod in namespace `talent` with the image `nginx:1.7.9`. The pod should be named `singer` and the container should be named `opera`. 

**Approximate Weight of Actual Exam Grade:** 3%

### Tasks

1. Create a Pod manifest as specified in the summary.
0. Persist the manifest to ETCD, having it be built in the `talent` namespace.
0. Verify the Pod was created successfully.

### Task Re-Do

1. Want to run the task again?? Run the following script to teardown your work.

    `student@bchd:~$` `teardown pod-basics`

## Task 3: Rollbacks

<details>
<summary>Click here to view this task!</summary>

### Objectives

In this task. you'll be rolling back a **Deployment** to a previously stable version. Deployments come equipped with amazing version control features which allow for rollbacks, and tracking revision history. Knowledge of the **kubectl rollout** command is what's being tested here. Permitted reference material you can use while taking the **CKAD** exam can be found [here from kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-to-a-previous-revision) -- Good luck!

### Recommended Labs:
- Lab 60 ðŸ’» Performing Rolling Updates and Rollbacks

### Task Setup

1. Run the following command to setup the task.  

    `student@bchd:~$` `drill deploy-rollbacks`

### Summary

There is an existing deployment named `mufasa` in namespace `king-of-lions`. Apparently the current version is broken. Check the deployment history and rollback to a version that actually works.
> Understand Deployments and how to perform rolling rollbacks. You could be given an existing deployment that is already several revisions old. Be prepared to rollback using kubectl to a previous version.

**Approximate Weight of Actual Exam Grade:** 4%

### Tasks

1. Identify the Deployment and view its revision history.
0. Perform the rollback to a version which works.
0. Verify the rollback completed successfully.

### Task Re-Do

1. Want to run the task again?? Run the following script to teardown your work.

    `student@bchd:~$` `teardown deploy-rollbacks`

</details>




## Task 4: ConfigMaps

<details>

<summary>Click here to view this task!</summary>

### Objectives

In this task. you'll create a **ConfigMap** and mount it as a volume to a **Pod**. ConfigMaps are used to pass **Environment Variables** and **Files** to Pods, so they always have the right settings and configurations every time they are built. Permitted reference material you can use while taking the **CKAD** exam can be found [here from kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) -- Good luck!

### Recommended Labs:
- Lab 39 ðŸ’» Persistent Configuration with ConfigMaps

### Task Setup

1. Run the following command to setup the task.  

    `student@bchd:~$` `drill configmaps`

### Summary

Create a ConfigMap called `metal-cm` containing the file `~/mycode/yaml/metal.html`. There is an existing manifest for a **Deployment** called `enter-sandman` located at `~/mycode/yaml/enter-sandman.yaml` which you will need to edit to add the `metal-cm` configmap mounted to the path `/var/www/index.html`. Create the deployment in the `metallica` **Namespace**.
> You'll likely be asked to create ConfigMaps, with either files or environment variables inside of them. You'll almost certainly be asked to mount these ConfigMaps as volumes or variables in a container. 

### Tasks

1. Create a ConfigMap as specified in the Summary.
0. Edit the `enter-sandman` manifest to mount the **ConfigMap** as outlined in the Summary.
0. Create the **Deployment** in the `metallica` **Namespace**.
0. Verify the **Deployment** was created successfully with the file mounted correctly.

### Task Re-Do

1. Want to run the task again?? Run the following script to teardown your work.

    `student@bchd:~$` `teardown configmaps`
    
</details>
    
    
    
## Task 5: SecurityContexts

<details>
<summary>Click here to view this task!</summary>
 
## Objectives

In this task. you'll create a **Pod** with a **SecurityContext** within a particular namespace. When taking the CKAD exam, bear in mind that the requirement to create a **SecurityContext** will not be plainly spelled out. Pay attention to the wording of the **Summary** in this one, as it is very similar to what you can expect to see on the exam. Permitted reference material you can use while taking the **CKAD** exam can be found [here from kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) -- Good luck!

### Recommended Labs:
- Lab 25 ðŸ’» Applying Security Contexts

### Task Setup

1. Run the following command to setup the task.  

    `student@bchd:~$` `drill securitycontexts`

### Summary

Create a pod called `gold-bar` on the `fort-knox` namespace, with the image `busybox:1.34.0` which assigns the Pod Service Account with the user ID `1000` and with the group ID `2000`. Set privilege escalation to false. Name the container `bullion`. Issue the following commands for your busybox container: `sh`, `-c`, and `sleep 1h`.
> If prompted, you would need to assign user, primary group, and/or secondary group processes to a whole Pod or a single container.

**Approximate Weight of Actual Exam Grade:** 5%

### Tasks

1. Create a Pod manifest as described by the task summary.
0. Create the pod in the `fort-knox` namespace.
0. Verify the pod was created successfully, with all of the requested parameters.

### Task Re-Do

1. Want to run the task again?? Run the following script to teardown your work.

    `student@bchd:~$` `teardown securitycontexts`
    
</details>
